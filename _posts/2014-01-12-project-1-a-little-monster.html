<p>Hello! I thought my first post should be about my first project. I really am just beginning with all this sewing malarkey so I decided to do something simple that would help me get used to the sewing machine.<!--more--></p>
<p>I started with a <a title="Monster Pattern" href="http://blog.revoluzzza.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/monster_ninni_tutorial_revoluzzza.pdf" target="_blank">free pdf pattern</a> for a "Monster" and set to one evening with some off-cuts of fabric from some of Bec's projects. I got to pinning and cutting and then stitching on the eyes and things. I didn't fancy trying tight circles as my first go on the machine, so I did the eyes and things by hand with some sparkly thread I found. Then to the main event.</p>
<p>First I sewed a few practice runs on some off cuts to work out the stitch I wanted for the mouth. I then proceeded to sew the mouth at entirely the wrong angle. Well, it <em>is</em> just a practice piece. Next time I think I'll have to draw a line on to follow, rather than trying to free hand a curve.</p>
<p>Next was sewing the pieces together. This was about the time I worked out that I hadn't been as careful as I thought with my cutting, and the was a big V chunk out of one of the arms. Thing to remember #2.</p>
<p>The actual stitching went easily enough. Although I didn't leave quite a big enough gap to turn it out, so had to unpick a little bit to get it tuned around. Once it was turned out I also found I'd gone a bit close to the edge, and the seams were not too tight. They looked like they'd start to come apart. For the worst one, I turned it back and re-did with the machine. For the others I went over them by hand just to firm them up.</p>
<p>Finally a bit of over-stuffing, and hand stitched the last part of the seam.</p>
<p>All in all this took about two hours, and I learned quite a bit. The pattern is really good, but I did find the hands and feet should be a bit bigger, they have come out a little bit small and they were really difficult to stuff properly.</p>
<p>The final result? Given to my wife (and stolen by my daughter!)</p>
