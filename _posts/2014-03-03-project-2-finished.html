<p>Well! Now we are all done.</p>
<p>I actually did the last part of the construction wrong, and worked it out when I came to do the slip stitching. Instead of pinning above the seam, and below the seam (so that when I machine stitched, I went through into the lining) I pinned below and above, so I'd left about 2 inches each side that should have been done. So that was easy enough to fix, re-pin, add a bit more stitching. Then the part that needed to be slip stitched was just a nice straight line. A bit of ironing, and a stitch and done.</p>
<p>That left just the button holes and the D-rings at the back. A quick lesson in how to use the sewing machine from The Boss later, and a lot of nice slow steady lines, and I had four button holes. The D-rings were just a straight stitch.</p>

<p>A bit of hand sewing got the buttons on...</p>

<p>Et Viola!</p>

<p>So now I've made a waist coat! I am amazed. I expected there would be whole loads I'd have to re-do, or that I'd get seams that wouldn't be straight. The back bottom line is probably not the best, but I am well happy.</p>
<p>Now how do I get these chalk marks off?</p>
