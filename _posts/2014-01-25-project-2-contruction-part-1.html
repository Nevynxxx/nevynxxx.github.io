<p>The construction phase has taken place over a few different days, with other things getting in the way. The fear of pressing the seams in wrong took over for a good week too, and it sat there staring at me pointedly. This morning I got over that, and a little while later we have the major part of the construction done.</p>

<p>The first thing was to sew a seam at the shoulders on both the lining and the "outer". Once this was done, I could really see the shape that was coming up.</p>
<p><a href="http://aiwaw.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/dsc_0028.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-20" alt="The front of me" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc_0028.jpg?w=440" width="440" height="586" /></a> The front of me</p>
<p><a href="http://aiwaw.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/dsc_0029.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-21" alt="The back of me" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc_0029.jpg?w=440" width="440" height="586" /></a> The back of me</p>
<p>Once this was done, the real fun began. Stitching the front to the lining, and turning out. I should have takenÂ  a photo of it half turned out, where the entire thing went through the shoulder, it was impressive!</p>
<p>There are two places that are not yet sewn up, although I'm not sure if it's supposed to be one place. Anyway, onto pressing in those seams...</p>
<p><a href="http://aiwaw.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/dsc_00301.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-22" alt="Pressing seams" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc_00301.jpg?w=440" width="440" height="330" /></a> Pressing seams - Please ignore my shoe!</p>
<p>So now it's looking something like the correct shape. I say something like, the lining is <em>very </em>slippery material, and things have gotten a little out of joint. Now just ready for that last pair of seams to be stitched together. If project #1 is anything to go by, this will be the most harrowing part. Wish me luck!</p>
