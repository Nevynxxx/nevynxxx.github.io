<p>Project #2! A bit of a jump from project #1 and a little bit more useful. My ultimate aim is to be able to make and steampunk up my own clothing. So I decided a good next step would be a waist coat. A proper pattern to follow, with instructions etc. lining, buttons and button holes.<!--more--></p>

<p>I've been Googling around and trying to find a pattern for a few days. This one looks good, and gets some good reviews and is pretty much the same price everywhere. I decided to have a look at local fabric shops before I ordered off the internet; I'd rather pay them than internet stores if I can. My local <em>did</em> have it and it made getting the fabric easier.</p>
<p>I picked out some nice black fabric for the waist coat, and some cheap black lining, with quite a lot of help from Bec and no help at all from the kids. The fabric I'm told has "a lot of wool in it" and "drapes really nicely" it's certainly nice to work with. The lining is a nice slippery synthetic. A bit of black thread and purchases done.</p>

<p>Laid out and pinned, can you see which bits my good Lady wife pinned and which bit I did? The "front" piece got re-pinned so it was actually flat, then we took the kids out to the park and cut it when we came back. In hindsight, that wasn't a good idea. I managed to lose the pattern piece for the interfacing (I later found this, Phew!).</p>
<p>Speaking of interfacing, it may have been a good idea to buy some of that! A quick visit to a crafty friend, and that problem was fixed. Looking at the pattern too, the piece for the interfacing can be worked out off the front piece, as it goes down the front of both sides to strengthen the edged holding the buttons and button holes.</p>
<p>So now I have lots of nicely cut out pieces waiting for the interfacing and the "strengthening" stitches to be done before we start construction. Not bad for a couple of hours on a Saturday.</p>
