<p>This part of the construction has taken ages. To be honest, that's because I was intimidated. After the mess I made of the slip stitch on Project #1 I didn't want to repeat on here! As it turns out, when I deciphered the instructions, I didn't need to worry too much. With the lining out of the way, the facing gets machine stitched to give a nice neat line easily that forms the outside seam. Once that's done the lining is the bit that will get slip stitched, and that stays inside where no one ever has to see it!<!--more--></p>
<p>This is the seam just before stitching.</p>
