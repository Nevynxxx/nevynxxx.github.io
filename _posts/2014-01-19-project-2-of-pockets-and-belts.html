<p>Just a short post this time. The next steps were to put some strengthening stitches in, and attach the interfacing, make the pocket, the belts and get the attached to the correct place.<!--more--></p>
<p>The strengthening stitches were first, and easiest. They run around the neck lines, and pretty much were just a straight stitch. Making the pocket came next and was a complete pain! An hour of umming and ahhing over the instructions, and practicing on the off-cut pocket, and we had a pocket pretty much as it should be. This is <em>not </em>the easiest of pockets, and being on the front it's going to be quite obvious it's not quite right. But this is a learning process so on with the next step.</p>

<p>The belts were easy enough. Stitched and turned out, then a bit of a faff to iron flat. They came out looking good though. All in all not much result for a few hours work, but plenty learned.</p>
